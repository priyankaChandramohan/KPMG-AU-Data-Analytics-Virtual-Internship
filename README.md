# KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics-virtual-internship
This repository contains my solutions and project work for the KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship offered by Forage. The virtual internship provides a hands-on learning experience in data analytics, allowing participants to gain practical skills and insights into the tasks and challenges faced by professionals at KPMG.

## About the Internship
The KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to simulate a real-world data analytics project. Participants will work on a fictional client project, analyzing data and providing insights to drive business decisions. The internship offers a comprehensive learning journey, covering various aspects of data analytics, including data quality assessment, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, data visualization, and presentation of findings.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of the virtual internship are as follows:
- Gain practical experience in data analysis and visualization.
- Apply data cleaning and preparation techniques to ensure data quality.
- Utilize data analytics tools and techniques for exploratory data analysis.
- Develop meaningful visualizations and dashboards to effectively communicate insights.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the data analysis to address the client's business challenges.

### This repository is organized as follows:
- [1. Data Quality Assessment](https://github.com/priyankaChandramohan/KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics-virtual-internship/tree/master/1.%20Data%20Quality%20Assessment): This directory contains:
  - the dataset provided for the internship project
  - a folder containing the cleaned data in .csv format with its .ipynb file containing the code and documentation
  - the merged csv file for data analysis
  - solution for the first task in both .docx and .pdf format.
- [2. Data Insights](https://github.com/priyankaChandramohan/KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics-virtual-internship/tree/master/2.%20Data%20Insights): This directory contains:
  - the template for task 2
  - the solution for the task in .pptx format
  - the 'data analysis' file for the interpretation and charts 
- [3. Data Insights and Presentation](https://github.com/priyankaChandramohan/KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics-virtual-internship/tree/master/3.%20Data%20Insights%20and%20Presentation): This directory includes the visualizations and dashboards created during the internship in .twbx format made with Tableau along with the xlsx files of current and target customers for data analysis.
- [Certificate of Completion_Priyanka Chandramohan](https://forage-uploads-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/completion-certificates/KPMG%20AU/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c_KPMG%20AU_kYyDDgYKqdAc5vyfF_1672676708075_completion_certificate.pdf): This contains the certificate of completion from KPMG AU and Forage.
- README.md: This file provides an overview of the internship and repository.

## Tasks and Solutions
Throughout the virtual internship, I have completed a series of tasks, implementing the necessary data analysis and visualization techniques. Each task is documented in the respective Jupyter Notebook within the first two directories. Additionally, the visualizations and dashboards generated during the internship can be found in the 3. Data Insights and Presentation/ directory.
